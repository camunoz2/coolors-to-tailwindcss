# Tailwind Color Converter

This project allows you to easily convert colors from the popular color palette generator coolors.co to Tailwind CSS classes. This can be useful if you want to use the colors from your coolors.co palette in a project that uses Tailwind CSS for styling.

## Features

Convert a list of RGB values separated by dashes (as found in the URL on coolors.co) to the closest Tailwind CSS classes.
The closest colors may not always have the same shading, but they should be close enough in appearance.

## Technologies Used

This project is built with Vite and Tailwind CSS.
